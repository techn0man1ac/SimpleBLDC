Simple BLDC 3-Phase BLDC motor driver specs:
- Battery: 8S 
- VCC: 24.0V to 33.6V
- I(max): 20A 
- Ð¡urrent measurements per phase

# Schematic

The device has 3 drivers for mosfet transistors, as well as 3 current sensors based on the Hall effect, which measure both in the positive and negative directions. The use of 3 sensors is the reason for the development of the device for regenerative braking.

# PCB

The board consists of two layers: top and bottom. All the main parts are located on the top layer.
